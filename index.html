        <div class="tip">
          <h3>Tip #1</h3>
          <p>When fishing from a boat, pay attention to the water temperature and structure. Look for temperature breaks and underwater features like reefs and drop-offs, which can attract fish.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
          <h3>Tip #2</h3>
          <p>When surf fishing, use sand crabs or worms as bait. Cast your line into the troughs between waves, where predatory fish often hunt for food.</p>
